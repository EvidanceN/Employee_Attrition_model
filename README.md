### Aim

---

To utilize the employee attrition data to understand what causes employee attrition and create a predictive model to predict employees that are likely to leave the company. This model will help companies understand which factors influence employee attrition and what they can do retain valuable employees.

### Data source

Kaggle: [Employee Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/employee-attrition-dataset?select=train.csv)

### Tools

- Azure Machine Learning Studio
- AutoML
- PowerBI - Creating reports

#### Data cleaning
1. Import necessary libraries.
2.  Read your dataset .
3. Prepare data for training.

### Model training
The model was trained using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel (kernel='linear') because it works well with datasets with a large number of features

classifier = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')

### Save the model



###  Test the Model
